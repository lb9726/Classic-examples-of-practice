On our return , it was getting bark. Despite being tired,we felt what a meaningful day we spent today                  
Despite:是介词后面不接从句   being tired tired 是形容词 adj 做宾语时前面要加being 
如果用Although 后面接从句
不能直接接句子。但可以用一个固定结构接句子。despite the fact that......


although是连词,翻译成尽管、虽然,通常用在句首或句中.
例如Although he is only seven,he really knows a lot.
或者He really knows a lot,although he is only seven.
despite也翻译成尽管,但它是个介词,这是与although的最大区别.
举个例子：Despite his young age,he really knows a lot.
也就是说despite后面只能加名词性短语或代词.
